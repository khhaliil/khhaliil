-  Task Automation: Programming the robot to perform tasks such as repotting plants, orienting solar panels, ensuring pollination, and managing energy resources autonomously.
-  Strategy Optimization: Utilizing AI to develop dynamic strategies for maximizing points and efficiency based on real-time data and environmental analysis.
# Technologies
-  Robot Operating System (ROS) for integrating various hardware and software components.
-  Machine Learning for predictive analytics and decision-making processes.
-  Computer Vision to accurately perceive the environment and interpret visual data for task execution.
# Challenges
-  Developing a robot that can autonomously navigate a complex environment with precision.
-  Creating an intelligent system capable of making real-time decisions based on sensor inputs.
-  Ensuring robust and reliable performance under competitive and varying conditions.
# Current Progress
-  Successfully implemented basic autonomous navigation and sensor integration.
-  Developing machine learning models for enhanced decision-making and task performance.
-  Experimenting with computer vision techniques for improved environmental interaction.
